# Gym-Booking-Bot
The problem is simple.... Due to covid regulations, my gym now has a manditory booking policy. Training times are realeased 24 hours prior to the session, but for the most popular sessions, they get booked up only a few minutes after release. Given that I generally have only 1 night a week when I can train, the cost of missing a booking time is personally quite high.

To avoid this, I designed a basic booking bot which, using Python and Selenium, logs onto the website and books a chosen training time.

Techniques:
Python
Selenium
WayScript - A cloud scripting platform

## Next Steps
An sms/email confirmation will be added to confirm the booking/completion of the script.
