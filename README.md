# Gym-Booking-Bot
The problem is simple.... Due to covid regulations, my gym now has a manditory booking policy. Training times are realeased 24 hours prior to the session, but for the most popular sessions, they get booked up only a few minutes after release. Given that I generally only have 1 night a week when I can train, the cost of missing a booking time is personally quite high.

To avoid this, I designed a basic booking bot which, using python and Selenium, logs onto the website and books a chosen training time.

## Next Steps

This is currently an inital basic script and will be amended to work with with WayScript, select the slot via a basic input, and finally send an sms to me to confirm the booking.
